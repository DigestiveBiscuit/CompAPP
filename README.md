# Compy

  

Compy is an iOS app created for Software Engineering 20/21.

  

### Imports

  

Compy uses a number of libraries to work properly:

  

* [FSCalendar] - Easy and stylish calender setup, with date selection function

* [UIKIT] - UI parts and pieces.

* [UserNotifcations] - Push notifications and Lock screen notifications.

* [Cocoapods] - Library importer for Xcode

  

### Installation

  

Compy requires a simulated iOS device or an official iOS device(iPhone, iPad, iPod) to run. However since it is currently not listed on the App Store, it can only be ran on a simulated iOS device, through Xcode.

  

  

1. Extract the zip to a folder so you are left with the CompApp folder and the _MACOSX.

2. Open a Terminal in the folder

3.

```sh

$ cd WhereverYouStoredIt/CompApp/

$ open CompApp.xcworkspace

```

And then build and run in an iPhone 11 Simulator. It's as simple as that.
